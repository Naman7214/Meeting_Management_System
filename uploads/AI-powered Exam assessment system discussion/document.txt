The OCR engine for handwritten text is functional but requires further optimization for different handwriting styles.
Diagram recognition accuracy is below expectations and needs additional training data.
The integration of LLMs to handle handwriting diversity is under development but progressing well.
The initial UI/UX designs for dashboards are ready for review.


Open Questions:
What additional data should be collected to improve diagram recognition accuracy?
How should the UI/UX accommodate different user types (students vs. teachers)?
What is the timeline for LLM integration completion?
